Problem Statement: Building a predictive traffic modelling tool that analyses historical traffic data, weather forecasts, and special events calendars to anticipate traffic congestion hotspots and recommend alternative routes or travel times to avoid delays.
Developing a Cost-Effective Traffic Monitoring System Using  Microprocessors


Description : 
This presentation outlines traffic management solutions using Raspberry Pi and Camera Module with real-time vehicle detection, pedestrian safety systems, and smart traffic control mechanisms.
Provide functionalities similar to expensive AI cameras at a fraction of the cost.
Limitations of Current Systems
Expensive AI Cameras:
Cost per Unit: ₹200,000 to ₹500,000 INR.
Total Cost for Multiple Junctions: Prohibitively expensive for widespread deployment.




Key features : 
-affordable
-scalable
-open source
-repairability
-upgradeability
-low power consumption

Technology used :
-Using Raspberry Pi and PI Camera as hardware and OpenCV for real-time detection.
